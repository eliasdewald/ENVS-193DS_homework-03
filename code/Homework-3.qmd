# Problem 1. Personal data

## a. 

I could calculate mean sleep duration to compare average sleep duration between 
types of day because I believe I sleep more on work days than normal days due
to being busier on those days.

## b. 

```{r}
avg_sleep <- project_data |>  # creating new object from data
  select(day_type, sleep_duration) |>  # selecting columns of interest
  group_by(day_type) |>   # grouping by day_type
  summarise(mean = mean(sleep_duration), # calculate mean
            n = length(sleep_duration)) # calculate sample size
ggplot(data = project_data, # plot with avg_sleep frame
       aes(x = day_type, # set x-axis
       y = sleep_duration, # set y axis
       color = day_type)) + # color by day type
  geom_jitter(width = 0.2, # make points jitter horizontally
               height = 0, # make sure points don't jitter along y-axis
              alpha = 0.5, # make points more transparent
              shape = 21, # make points open circles
              size = 2) + # set size of jittered points
  geom_point(data = avg_sleep, # plot means 
              size = 3, # set size of points
              aes(x = day_type,
                  y = mean)) + # set x-axis
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Normal" = "coral", # set color for normal day
                 "Work" = "deepskyblue")) + # set color for work day
  theme(legend.position = "none", # make sure legend doesn't show
        panel.background = element_rect("white"), # make background white
        panel.grid = element_blank()) + # remove grid
  labs(x = "Day type", # label x-axis
       y = "Sleep duration (hours)", # label y-axis
       title = "Average sleep duration across normal and work days") 
       # name plot title
      
```

## c. 

**Figure 1.** Sleep duration tends to be higher on normal days than on work 
days. Data from 'projectdata.csv'. Large filled in points represent mean sleep
duration for normal (n = 22) and work (n = 16) days. Small transparent open 
points represent observations of sleep duration for normal and work days. Colors 
represent type of day (Orange: nomral, Blue: Work).

## d. 

```{r}
table <- flextable(avg_sleep, # make new object from avg_sleep object
                   col_keys = c("day_type", "mean")) |> 
  # select colums of interst
  set_header_labels(table, day_type = "Type of day", # rename column titles
                    mean = "Mean sleep duration") |> 
  colformat_double(digits = 1) # round values to one decimal point
table # display table

                                
```


# 2. 

## a. 

My personal data is focused on sleep. I think I could draw a graph made up of 
two beds to represent sleep. One bed would represent the sleep I get on normal
days, and the other would represent the sleep I get on work days. I could make
the beds look different to portray the type of day they correspond to.

## d. 

I am showing my average sleep duration for normal days and work days through
the lengths of the beds and the type of day through what objects are on each of 
the beds. For example, the normal day bed has a school backpack on it and the 
work day one has a shovel. I was influenced by Jill Pelto's paintings which 
visualizes data through art. I thought incorporating art into a graph to 
visualize data was a neat idea. The form of my affective visualization is a 
graphical drawing utilizing colored pens and pencil. 

# 3. 

## a. 

The paper includes multiple statistical tests, so I was recommended to go with 
the four standard one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests done on the data
that was displayed in an important figure. The response variable is M. 
polymorpha seedling dry weight (mg/seedling) and the predictor variable is the concentration of aqueous extract (%) of each plant as there was one ANOVA test 
for each plant.

## b. 

For the most part, the authors represented their statistics well. The means and 
standard errors are visualized clearly with bars and vertical bars, 
respectively. The axes and legend are clear and in logical positions. However, 
the underlying data is not included and there are no mentions of the results of
the ANOVA tests in either the figure or the figure caption.

## c. 

The authors handed visual clutter well. It is easy to understand what the figure
is displaying and there aren't distracting and uninformative aspects being 
visualized. The data:ink ratio is high. 

## d. 

The figure is generally good, but I think it could use one slight addition. 
Adding different letters above each bar to indicate significant differences 
found through the ANOVA tests could be helpful. They could take the same 
approach they did with a previous table within the paper. In the table, a letter 
"a" above a number meant there was a statistically significant difference 
between that number and a number with a letter "b", "c", or "d" above it, based
on the ANOVA test done on the data from that specific plant. This could be 
adopted for the figure where instead of a letter above a number it could be 
placed above the corresponding bar in the graph. It may add some visual clutter,
but it would communicate the results of the statistical tests better.
