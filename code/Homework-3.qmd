# Problem 1. Personal data

## a. 

I could calculate mean sleep duration to compare average sleep duration between 
types of day because I believe I sleep more on work days than normal days due
to being busier on those days.

## b. 

```{r}
avg_sleep <- project_data |>  # creating new object from data
  select(day_type, sleep_duration) |>  # selecting columns of interest
  group_by(day_type) |>   # grouping by day_type
  summarise(mean = mean(sleep_duration), # calculate mean
            n = length(sleep_duration)) # calculate sample size
ggplot(data = project_data, # plot with avg_sleep frame
       aes(x = day_type, # set x-axis
       y = sleep_duration, # set y axis
       color = day_type)) + # color by day type
  geom_jitter(width = 0.2, # make points jitter horizontally
               height = 0, # make sure points don't jitter along y-axis
              alpha = 0.3, # make points more transparent
              shape = 21, # make points open circles
              size = 2) + # set size of jittered points
  geom_point(data = avg_sleep, # plot means 
              size = 4, # set size of points
              aes(x = day_type,
                  y = mean)) + # set x-axis
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Normal" = "coral", # set color for normal day
                 "Work" = "deepskyblue")) + # set color for work day
  theme(legend.position = "none", # make sure legend doesn't show
        panel.background = element_rect("white"), # make background white
        panel.grid = element_blank()) + # remove grid
  labs(x = "Day type", # label x-axis
       y = "Sleep duration (hours)", # label y-axis
       title = "Average sleep duration across normal and work days") 
       # name plot title
      
```

## c. 

**Figure 1.** Sleep duration tends to be higher on normal days than on work 
days. Data from 'projectdata.csv'. Large filled in points represent mean sleep
duration for normal (n = 22) and work (n = 16) days. Small transparent open 
points represent observations of sleep duration for normal and work days. Colors 
represent type of day (Orange: nomral, Blue: Work).

## d. 

```{r}
table <- flextable(avg_sleep, # make new object from avg_sleep object
                   col_keys = c("day_type", "mean")) |> 
  # select colums of interst
  set_header_labels(table, day_type = "Type of day", # rename column titles
                    mean = "Mean sleep duration") |> 
  colformat_double(digits = 1) # round values to one decimal point
table # display table

                                
```


# 2. 

## a. 

My personal data is focused on sleep. I think I could draw a graph made up of 
two beds to represent sleep. One bed would represent the sleep I get on normal
days, and the other would represent the sleep I get on work days. I could make
the beds look different to portray the type of day they correspond to.

# 3. 

## a. 

The paper includes multiple statistical tests, so I was recommended to go with 
the four standard one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests done on the data
that was displayed in an important figure. The response variable is M. 
polymorpha seedling dry weight (mg/seedling) and the predictor variable is the concentration of aqueous extract (%) of each plant as there was one ANOVA test 
for each plant.
